      <p>
        TextUtils is a simple React app that allows you to perform various text manipulations, such as counting words and characters, changing the font, converting text to uppercase, copying text to the clipboard, and clearing the text.

        This app is built using React and utilizes React's useState hook for managing state. It also uses some basic CSS for styling the user interface.
